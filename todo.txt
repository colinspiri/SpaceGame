TODO:

Current Commit:
-fix camera movement - instead of moving to mouseX, move camera normally and move ship inside shrunken down screen box
-give asteroids random velocity directions (but still with positive z)

Later:
-make facingDirection be a vector from ship.position to the nose of the ship so yaw, pitch, roll changes it, not the finger
-fix Pause menu
-make asteroids explode because of lasers
-make ship hitbox a sphere around it

QUESTIONS/BUGS/ISSUES:
-fill() doesn't work with PShape ?
-sphere-sphere collision detection is broken (asteroids-lasers)
-everything lags a lot (maybe because of background - try background(0) and just small static star objects in background)
