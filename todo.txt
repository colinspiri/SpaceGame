TODO:

-make ship wireframe
-add leap roll, pitch, yaw
-fix camera movement - instead of moving to mouseX, move camera normally and move ship inside shrunken down screen box
-fix Pause menu
-make asteroids explode because of lasers
-laser sound effects
-make ship hitbox a sphere around it

QUESTIONS/BUGS/ISSUES:
-fill() doesn't work with PShape ?
-sphere-sphere collision detection is broken (asteroids-lasers)
-everything lags a lot (maybe because of background - try background(0) and just small static star objects in background)
