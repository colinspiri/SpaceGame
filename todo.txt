TODO:

Current Commit:
-make score system - score goes up when you shoot asteroids or fly through rings

Later:
-make lasers charge up when you don't fire
-make facingDirection be a vector from ship.position to the nose of the ship so yaw, pitch, roll changes it, not the finger
-make ship able to speed up or slow down slightly
-make health bar
-make asteroids a lighter color

Ambitious:
-try 3d navigation where asteroids are relatively stationary but you can look around yourself - like a starfox dogfight - separate branch
	-other ship wants to shoot you down

QUESTIONS/BUGS/ISSUES:
-fill() doesn't work with PShape ?
-everything lags a lot (maybe because of background - try background(0) and just small static star objects in background)
