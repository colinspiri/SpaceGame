TODO:

Current Commit:
-make ship health deplete when hit by asteroid

Later:
-make asteroids explode because of lasers
-make lasers charge up when you don't fire
-make lasers affect health of asteroids instead of making them die immediately
-make facingDirection be a vector from ship.position to the nose of the ship so yaw, pitch, roll changes it, not the finger
-fix Pause menu
-make rings to fly through
-try 3d navigation where asteroids are relatively stationary but you can look around yourself - like a starfox dogfight - separate branch
	-other ship wants to shoot you down

QUESTIONS/BUGS/ISSUES:
-fill() doesn't work with PShape ?
-everything lags a lot (maybe because of background - try background(0) and just small static star objects in background)
-asteroids are colored
