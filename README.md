# The Conceit:
-maneuver a ship as it zooms faster and faster through space
-take damage if you crash into an asteroid
-recover health by flying through rings
-shoot asteroids and fly through rings to gain points
-accrue as many points before dying to earn your chance at a high score (that persists from game to game)

# The Controls:
-Use your right hand above the Leap Motion Controller to control the wireframe ship
-move your hand in the X-Y plane parallel with the Leap to maneuver the ship
-rotate your hand with 3 degrees of freedom to rotate the ship
-point your index finger in a direction to aim the ship's lasers
-leave your thumb extended by default, hide your thumb underneath your hand to fire lasers at a fixed fire rate
